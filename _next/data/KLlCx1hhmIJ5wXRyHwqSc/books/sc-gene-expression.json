We have designed this workshop for students of\nbiomedicine interested in interactive single-cell gene expression\ndata analysis. You will see how you can accomplish single-cell data\nmining tasks without programming. We will use Orange, its\nbioinformatics and single-cell add-ons to construct reproducible,\nshareable, and visual data mining workflows.\n\nIf you haven’t already installed Orange, please download the\ninstallation package from https://orange.biolab.si, install Orange,\nand then install the add-ons for Bioinformatics and Single-Cell\nData Analysis.\n\n<!!! width-30 !!!>\n![](/images/books/sc-gene-expression/fig1.png)\n\n***Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs CC BY-NC-ND***","chapters":[{"frontmatter":{"title":"Workflows in Orange","date":"November 1986"},"content":"\nOrange workflows consist of components that read, process, and\nvisualize data. We refer to these components as “widgets” We place\nthe widgets on a drawing board called the “canvas” to design a workflow. Widgets communicate by sending information along their communication channel. Output from one widget can be used as input to\nanother.\n\n<!!! width-max !!!>\n![](/images/chapters/workflows-in-orange/workflow-fig1.png)\n\n<!!! float-aside !!!>\nA simple workflow with two connected\nwidgets and one widget without connections. The outputs of a widget appear on the right, while the inputs appear on the left.\n\nWe construct workflows by dragging widgets onto the canvas and\nconnecting them by drawing a line from the transmitting widget to\nthe receiving widget. The widget’s outputs are on the right, and the\ninputs on the left. In the workflow above, the File widget sends data\nto the Data Table widget.\n\nStart by constructing a workflow that consists of a File widget, two\nScatter Plot widgets and two Data Table widgets:\n\n<!!! float-aside !!!>\nA workflow with a File widget that\nreads the data from a disk and sends\nit to the Scatter Plot and Data Table\nwidget. The Data Table renders the\ndata in a spreadsheet, while the Scatter Plot visualizes it. The plot’s selected data points are sent to two other\nwidgets: Data Table (1) and Scatter\nPlot (1).\n\n![](/images/chapters/workflows-in-orange/workflow-fig2.png)\n\nThe File widget reads data from your local disk. Open the File\nwidget by double-clicking its icon. Orange comes with several preloaded data sets. From these (“Browse documentation data sets...”),\nchoose brown-selected.tab, a yeast gene expression data set.\n\n<!!! float-aside !!!>\nOrange workflows often start with a\nFile widget. The brown-selected data\nset comprises 186 rows (genes) and\n81 columns. Out of the 81 columns,\n79 contain gene expressions of baker’s\nyeast under various conditions, one column (marked as a ”meta attribute”)\nprovides gene names, and one column contains the ”class” value or gene\nfunction.\n\n![](/images/chapters/workflows-in-orange/file-brown.png)\n\nAfter you load the data:\n1. Open the other widgets.\n2. Select a few data points in the Scatter Plot widget and watch as\nthey appear in the Data Table (1)\n3. Use a combination of two Scatter Plot widgets, where the second\nscatter plot shows a detail from a smaller region selected in the first\nscatter plot.\nThe following is a side note, but it won’t hurt. The scatter plot for\na pair of random features does not provide much information on gene\nfunction. Does this change with a different choice of feature pairs in\nthe visualization? Rank projections at the button on the top left of\nthe Scatter Plot widget can help you find a good feature pair. How do\nyou think this works? Could the suggested pairs of features be helpful\nto a biologist?\n\n<!!! float-aside !!!>\n<p>\n    <img src=\"/images/chapters/workflows-in-orange/score-plots.png\" />\n    Scatter Plot and Ranking\n</p>\n\n![](/images/chapters/workflows-in-orange/scatterplot-brown.png)\n\nWe can connect the output of the Data Table widget to the Scatter\nPlot widget to highlight the chosen data instances (rows) in the scatter\nplot.\n\n<!!! float-aside !!!>\nIn this workflow, we have switched on\nthe option ”Show channel names between widgets” in File/Preferences.\n\n![](/images/chapters/workflows-in-orange/workflow-fig5.png)\n\nHow does Orange distinguish between the primary data source and\nthe data selection?
